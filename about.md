## The VIP Model

The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program is a nonprofit alliance of colleges and universities that engages students in long-term, large-scale, faculty-led research. 




## The VIP Consortium

Currently, VIP includes 50+ universities across 13 countries, each adapting the model in its own way to fit their institutional culture. Students from all backgrounds from STEM to Humanities are encouraged to participate. Look at the [Vertically Integrated Projects Consortium] (https://www.vip-consortium.org/) for more information.

## VIP at MSU

At MSU, VIP program started in the spring semester of 2026 through the efforts of Dirk Colbry.
