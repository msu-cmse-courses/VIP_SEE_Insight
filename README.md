# Vertically Integrated Projects

The Vertically Integrated Projects at Michigan State University connects undergraduate students from all disciplines to long-term research led by faculty and graduate students.Students can earn academic credit simultaneously in MSU's VIP program. Faculty and graduate mentors can gain valuable support and insights by letting students take variety of roles across multidisciplinary teams.


This is an unconventional course where students gain hands-on experience in collaborative, faculty driven projects from diverse backgrounds. These projects can last three semester which will be a total of 6 credits. Faculty members leading projects are departments of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

Students interested in VIP are encouraged to look at the faculty and the syllabus to see if they are interested.
